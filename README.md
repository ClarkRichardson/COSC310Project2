Description
Our project was a call center agent that can handle several different types of issues and a few responses. The call agent directs the user towards important information that they request, like help with assembly, acquiring information on their shipments, or filing complaints and getting reviews. The team repository can be found here. 

Features: 
GUI:
The gui was created using the javax.swing library. It allowed the GUI to be implemented using a text area and a text field. This allowed for a simple and intuitive interface. This interface allows the user to see the history of the conversation by adding all lines of text to be stored in an array list of strings. Lines are added to the interface untill the maximum number of lines that are able to be displayed. Once this point is reached the comments at the beginning of the list are deleted as new lines are added.
